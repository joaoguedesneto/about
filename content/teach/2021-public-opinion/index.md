title: Political Attitudes and Public Opinion
summary: In this course, we will dive deeply into public opinion. Our goal is to understand why people hold their political preferences, social identities, and, sometimes, uncivil attitudes toward those who they disagree with. As we get a grasp on the literature, we will move on to practical techniques--developing a survey, running it with a sample of American voters, and analyzing the results. In that process, students will be able to come up with their own questions and investigate whether their own theories explain political polarization in the United States.
