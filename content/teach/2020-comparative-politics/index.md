title: Comparative Politics
summary: In this introductory course of Comparative Politics, students will learn how domestic politics, political institutions (e.g., presidentialism vs. parliamentarism), and political behavior (e.g., identity and culture) operate and interact in different countries. Consider the cases of Hungary and Venezuela. While the two countries have followed completely different historical paths and are governed by parties from opposite ideological views, both have seen the profuse erosion of their democracy in the recent years. Why is it the case? In this course, students will learn how to recognize and interpret political events around the world (as the ones from Venezuela and Hungary) based on the relevant and widely used theories of the field.
