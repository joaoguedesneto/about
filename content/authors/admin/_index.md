I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at CEPESP/FGV. My main area of expertise is intergroup behavior, that is, I investigate how people interact in different settings, ranging from political polarization in elections around the world to inter-agency conflicts in public administration.

Prior to that, I was an Assistant Professor of Public Administration at Kean University.
