I am an Assistant Professor of Public Administration at FGV EBAPE. My research concentrates on the individual-level dynamics of bureaucratic politics. I rely on survey experiments, econometrics, and face-to-face interviews to understand coordination problems, the politics of policy implementation, and other aspects of intergroup relations. My work has appeared in outlets such as Comparative Political Studies, Representation, and Political Studies Review.

Currently, I am working on two book projects: “Bureaucratic Resistance to Illiberal Policies” (Cambridge University Press, co-authored with B. Guy Peters) and “Bureaucratic Polarization: How Workplace Identity and Intergroup Conflict Shape Policy Implementation” (Routledge).
