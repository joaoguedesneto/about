Descriptive representation is one of them. Yet, most scholars focus only on the social characteristics of representatives. Is it also possible to talk about a workplace descriptive representation? In this paper, I rely on a longitudinal survey conducted with 2,527 legislators from 18 Latin American countries to assess whether the preferences of those representatives with a background in the public service differ from those held by other congressmen. The results show that former public employees adequately represent their professional group only when they self-place in the left or highly identify with the civil service. Yet, when they do not, their preference for the maximisation of the state’s budget and power is even lower than that of rightist legislators who have never worked for government.","tags":["Descriptive Representation","Political Elites","Survey Analysis"],"title":"Bureaucrats as Legislators: The Conditional Roots of Workplace Descriptive Representation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["João V.

This article contributes to the debate on the social distance of party affect by testing a set of hypotheses in 165 elections across the world. With a sample of over 170,000 voters, the results of multilevel mixed-effects regressions demonstrate that ideological radicalism, political knowledge, and external efficacy substantively affect how voters see the main political parties in electoral disputes taking place in 52 countries from 1996 to 2019. Satisfaction with democracy, however, is context-dependent; it positively influences affective polarization only when generalized democratic satisfaction is low. Furthermore, I show that these correlations remain stable regardless of the operationalization of affective polarization—that is, based on two dominant parties and weighted for multiparty competition. These findings provide robust inputs to the study of party preferences and social distance in a cross-national longitudinal perspective.","tags":[],"title":"The Effects of Political Attitudes on Affective Polarization: Survey Evidence from 165 Elections","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":"Kean University (MPA)","content":"","date":1672622471,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672622471,"objectID":"5edc4f20b7d169821b3c205b9436b905","permalink":"https://joaoguedesneto.github.io/about/teach/2023-governing-nj/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T21:21:11-04:00","relpermalink":"/about/teach/2023-governing-nj/","section":"teach","summary":"Analysis of governmental institutions and decision-making processes in New Jersey state government; with particular emphasis on the role of the bureaucracy.

In 2008, the government of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, implemented a policy to take control of favelas that were previously dominated by organized crime groups (OCGs). We use day and night luminosity to assess the effects of this program on economic growth. The difference-in-differences design shows that state intervention has a significant and negative average treatment effect on the favelas that received the intervention. We further test a mechanism to explain this economic downturn: institutional replacement. Based on crime data, we demonstrate that this effect is caused by the destruction of local markets, especially illicit activities. The data highlight the perils of order transition, even when OCGs are removed by state actors. Furthermore, this paper reinforces the need for policies that are mindful of the externalities of institutional shifts.","tags":[],"title":"From Drug Lords to Police State: The Effects of Order Transition on Local Economies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Asbel Bohigues","João V.

In recent years, several countries have engaged in political disputes centred on these three issues. Scholarship has explored the topic from different perspectives, ranging from theories of democracy to voters’ political behaviour. Nonetheless, the perspective of political elites is still understudied. We use data from elite surveys in sixteen Latin American countries to address this question. First, we find significant differences between and within countries and political parties, meaning these issues are far from consensual. Second, we analyse the effects of ideology, religion, and socio-demographic characteristics. We confirm that ideology and religiosity are key predictors, but a deeper analysis shows that whereas those on the right and religious are strongly opposed to these issues, those on the left and less religious are not as strongly in favour.","tags":[],"title":"Latin American political elites’ positions on same-sex marriage, abortion, and drug legalization","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":"University of Pittsburgh (BA)","content":"","date":1621209600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621209600,"objectID":"10efbcab44a58cff8f7783a2265028d5","permalink":"https://joaoguedesneto.github.io/about/teach/2021-public-opinion/","publishdate":"2021-05-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/about/teach/2021-public-opinion/","section":"teach","summary":"In this course, we will dive deeply into public opinion.
