Descriptive representation is one of them. Yet, most scholars focus only on the social characteristics of representatives. Is it also possible to talk about a workplace descriptive representation? In this paper, I rely on a longitudinal survey conducted with 2,527 legislators from 18 Latin American countries to assess whether the preferences of those representatives with a background in the public service differ from those held by other congressmen. The results show that former public employees adequately represent their professional group only when they self-place in the left or highly identify with the civil service. Yet, when they do not, their preference for the maximisation of the state’s budget and power is even lower than that of rightist legislators who have never worked for government.","tags":["Descriptive Representation","Political Elites","Survey Analysis"],"title":"Bureaucrats as Legislators: The Conditional Roots of Workplace Descriptive Representation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["João V.

Satisfaction with democracy, however, is context-dependent; it positively influences affective polarization only when generalized democratic satisfaction is low. Furthermore, I show that these correlations remain stable regardless of the operationalization of affective polarization—that is, based on two dominant parties and weighted for multiparty competition.

In 2008, the government of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, implemented a policy to take control of favelas that were previously dominated by organized crime groups (OCGs). We use day and night luminosity to assess the effects of this program on economic growth. The difference-in-differences design shows that state intervention has a significant and negative average treatment effect on the favelas that received the intervention. We further test a mechanism to explain this economic downturn: institutional replacement. Based on crime data, we demonstrate that this effect is caused by the destruction of local markets, especially illicit activities. The data highlight the perils of order transition, even when OCGs are removed by state actors.

Second, we analyse the effects of ideology, religion, and socio-demographic characteristics.

In Latin America, where party systems are generally weak, this is a long-standing trend. However, it does not mean that legislators do not group themselves or assume identities to ease their cognitive formation of policy preferences. What shapes legislators’ attitudes toward safety net policies in Latin America? We test two hypotheses to predict these cues. First, descriptive representation. We assume that legislators who share a status-quo profile, ie older, wealthy, and highly-educated males, tend to share policy preferences. Second, business interests. We test whether having high-level jobs in the private sector and trusting employers’ organizations shape policy preferences. We conduct this investigation based on a dataset with interviews carried out with a large number of legislators from 17 Latin American countries. Our policies of interest are the ones that produce a stark cleavage in the region: The State’s role in the provision of a safety net to the poorer strata of the population. We confirm the first hypothesis and show that descriptive representation has a stronger predictive power of policy preferences than strong ties with the business sector at least when it comes to the selected policies.","tags":[],"title":"Status Quo Characteristics or Private Sector Affinity?
